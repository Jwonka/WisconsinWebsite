          <h2>Overview of Green Bay</h2>
          <p>
            Green Bay, located in Northeast Wisconsin, was incorporated in 1854.  This urban city is also the oldest in Wisconsin, gathering its roots as a trading outpost for the French in 1624 and has since grown to a population of 107,000.  Although the median household income in Green Bay is $59,000, lower than the rest of Wisconsin's median income of $72,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau (2022), it still offers a high quality of life, offering residents a welcoming community and abundant recreational opportunities.  It is the smallest city in the United States to have a professional sports team (Green Bay Packers), which has earned it the nickname Titletown.  Green Bay also has several colleges, including the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. The city has a thriving economy bolstered by manufacturing, healthcare, and retail.  Green Bay has also earned the nickname "toilet paper capital of the world" because it's where the first splinter-free toilet paper came from. The paper industry has been a driving economic force in Green Bay, where name brands such as Quilted Northern started.  Green Bay is a fantastic vacation destination with a strong economy and excellent recreational activities, such as attending the Green Bay Packers.
